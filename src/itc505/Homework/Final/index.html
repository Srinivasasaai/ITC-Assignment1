      <h3>Addendum</h3>
      Understanding the Rules: I started by understanding the rules of the
      Lights Out game, where clicking a cell toggles its state and the adjacent
      cells. I clarified the goal of turning off all the lights on the grid and
      the condition for winning. Technical Implementation: I implemented the
      game logic using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The grid was dynamically
      generated based on the chosen grid size. Each cell was made clickable to
      toggle its state and the adjacent cells. Random Solvable Board Generation:
      To create a solvable but random initial board, I initially faced the
      challenge of avoiding unsolvable configurations. I implemented a function
      that randomly toggles cells, ensuring a solvable starting point. <br />
      Visual Design: Chose a simple and clean design to keep the focus on
      gameplay. Used a monochrome color scheme to emphasize the on/off states of
      the lights. Button Visibility: Implemented a button visibility toggle to
      show either the "Start Game" or "Restart Game" button based on the game
      state. This choice improves user experience by providing clear actions
      based on the current state of the game. <br />
      Random Board Generation: <br />

      Challenge: Ensuring a randomly generated board is always solvable. <br />
      Solution: Implemented a function that toggles cells randomly, guaranteeing
      solvability. <br />
      Button Visibility Toggle: <br />

      Challenge: Managing the visibility of the "Start Game" and "Restart Game"
      buttons. <br />
      Solution: Created a function to toggle button visibility based on the game
      state. <br />
