      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) driven by machine learning (ML) algorithms
        is a branch in computer science that is rapidly gaining popularity
        within the healthcare sector. Recent regulatory approvals of AI-driven
        companion diagnostics and other products are glimmers of a future in
        which these tools could play a key role by defining the way medicine
        will be practiced. Educating the next generation of medical
        professionals with the right ML techniques will enable them to become
        part of this emerging data science revolution.

      <section #introduction><h2>Introduction</h2> 
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to help deliver precision
          medicine and health. <a href="#References">[1,2]</a> The clinical and biomedical research communities
          are increasingly embracing this modality to develop tools for diagnosis
          and prediction as well as to improve delivery and effectiveness of
          healthcare. New breakthroughs are being developed in an unprecedented
          fashion and the developed ones have obtained regulatory approval and
          found their way into routine medical practice.<a href="#References">[3,5]</a> Yet, the medical
          school curriculum as well as the graduate medical education and other
          teaching programs within academic hospitals across the United States and
          around the world have not yet come to grips with educating students and
          trainees on this emerging technology. Several expert opinions have
          pointed to the benefits and limitations associated with the use of ML in
          medicine,<a href="#References">[1,2,6–10]</a> but the aspect related to formally educating the
          younger generation of medical professionals has not been openly
          discussed.

      <h3>Rise of Machines</h3>
      <p>
        The rising popularity of machine learning (ML) techniques for medical
        applications is evident from the increasing amount of research conducted
        on this topic, the number of products that are obtaining regulatory
        approvals as well as the entrepreneurial efforts in this space over the
        past few years. A PubMed search with “machine learning” as the MeSH term
        shows that the number of papers published in the area of ML is largely
        increasing since the beginning of this decade (Fig. 1). On the other
        hand, the number of publications related to undergraduate and graduate
        medical education have remained relatively unchanged since 2010. A
        combined search using the MeSH terms “machine learning” and “graduate
        medical education” between 2010 and 2017 resulted in 16 publications.
        Detailed review of these papers revealed that none of them were actually
        focused on ML education for medical professionals. Also, a similar
        search on the ClinialTrials.gov website with “machine learning” as the
        keyword showed an increase in the number of registered clinical trials
        on an annual basis since the beginning of this decade (Fig. 2a). Further
        inspection revealed that these clinical trials were registered by
        organizations from various countries around the world (Fig. 2b). Lastly,
        it is interesting to note that healthcare has arguably one of the
        highest number of venture capital (VC) backed AI startups, and this
        figure is gradually increasing. VC funding for healthcare AI companies
        was about $3.6 billion in the last 5 years.<a href="#References">[11]</a> The above facts underscore
        the increasing appreciation of the value that ML can potentially bring
        to the medical community. If this trend continues, then we may very well
        see a large number of AI-driven products and technologies integrated
        within the healthcare ecosystem in the coming decades. The question then
        remains as to whether a medical professional is willing to embrace these
        tools as part of their repertoire and if so, how they can get educated
        in terms of knowing the “art” as well as the “science” of the ML
        algorithms driving these technologies.

      <section id="Lack of student access to ML content">
      <h3>Lack of student access to ML content</h3>
      <p>
        Lack of direct access to appropriate ML education for clinicians and
        biomedical researchers is not surprising. Multiple factors contribute to
        the failure of ML to be embedded within undergraduate and graduate
        medical education training. Currently, there are no accreditation
        requirements related to AI. Additionally, medical schools are already
        struggling to maintain curricular hours in the current schema with ever
        growing biomedical knowledge and calls for new content areas. In the
        United States, assessment in undergraduate medical education, which
        drives much of learning, is largely focused on preparation for licensing
        exams and a recent competency focus on entrustable professional
        activities (EPA’s), neither of which include AI<a href="#References">[12,13]</a> To add to this
        dilemma, similar to the early experience with quality improvement and
        patient safety education, medical schools lack the faculty expertise
        required to teach this content which is largely taught in the computer
        science, mathematics and engineering faculties. Lack of mentorship and
        faculty role modeling poses a significant challenge as students move
        from the preclinical to clinical environment and try to develop
        understanding of how AI knowledge can be applied and used in the
        clinical setting. AI impacts patients and patient care. Therefore, ML
        and its applications should be taught within medical school and needs to
        be formalized to train the next generation of clinicians and biomedical
        scientists to face datadriven challenges that can directly impact
        patient care in the coming decades.

    <section id="recomendations">
      <h3>Curricular recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        Any curriculum designed to address ML should aim for machine learning
        literacy rather than proficiency. ML-related content can be embedded
        within a larger curricular construct that is focused on competence in
        using information technology to improve patient care. Although the
        natural inclination for most schools would be to focus training on how
        to use technology like the electronic health record (EHR), curricular
        leaders should be cautioned. Information technology, including ML
        curricula in medical education could begin with a focus on population
        health and the impact it can have on disease prediction, risk
        stratification, and management. Students could initially be introduced
        to ML through courses focused on population health and evidencebased
        medicine in which ML becomes an additional tool for the clinician to
        provide care. As stated in the EPA’s, the entrustable student would be
        “able to identify and use several available databases, search engines,
        or other appropriate tools, resulting in a manageable volume of
        information, most of which is relevant to the clinical question”. 14
        Students in the preclinical phase could be introduced to studies and
        databases that have highlighted the impact of natural language
        processing, data science, and thus the impact of ML on healthcare
        systems<a href="#References">[15,16]</a> Simulated ML and EHR platforms should be taught
        simultaneously while students practice searching data and asking
        questions. Trainees should also learn the benefits, risks, and the
        ethical dilemmas that exist when using ML. As they transition to the
        clinical years, ML should become experiential and students should be
        exposed to already developed and tested diagnostic tools that could
        potentially be used in hospitals at the point of care. When students
        gain experience in using ML-based diagnostic tools, they would begin to
        recognize the conditions and future applications where AI could
        potentially benefit clinical decision making and management. There is
        also an opportunity to develop healthcare leaders with expertize in big
        data and ML. Additional coursework should be developed through
        electives, as part of leadership or business tracks, and combined
        programs such as MD/MBA, MD/MPH, and MD/PhD. Students participating in
        these advanced experiences may spend more time understanding the role of
        computer programming and developing coding skills. This does not mean
        that students should have extensive experience in programming but they
        should be open to learning a programming language and writing some
        computer codes during the class and beyond. In today’s day and age, this
        task is not impossible because adoption of ML by several scientific
        communities has led to the development of free, user-friendly software
        and other educational content that is easily understandable to general
        audience and available over the internet (i.e., GitHub, Medium, Stack
        Overflow, etc.). Programming skills would allow students to consider
        alternative careers in addition to the practice of medicine which may
        help to more rapidly integrate ML into medicine.

      <h3>Suggestions to the ML course instructor</h3>
      <p>
        At most schools, the instructor will most likely be a data scientist.
        Therefore, the ML expert needs to limit the use of heavy jargon in the
        classroom, if possible. Mathematical and computational underpinnings
        that are seemingly overwhelming to the inexperienced trainee need to be
        explained in a simple fashion. The intent of instruction should be to
        not expose trainees with tedious definitions or equations but teach them
        the concepts and make them comfortable with the tools so that they can
        begin to tackle a new data challenge without getting bogged down by the
        terminology. Students can be a lot more attentive and focus on the
        concepts when they do not feel the need to quickly search the meaning of
        a technical term over the internet during the class. The instructor
        should also recommend practical guidelines to choosing the right tools.
        Lectures and tutorials should be filled with realworld clinical
        examples. This is where the instructor’s creativity would come to play.
        Relevant examples along with provision of datasets and healthcare
        challenges would facilitate students to gain the practical know-how
        needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.
        While this article is just meant to provide an outline and a potential
        curricular structure to embed ML content within a medical school, this
        list is by no means exhaustive. Also, things not covered here are the
        type of ML techniques and assessments that should be included throughout
        training. When students complete this introductory experience, they
        should be in a position to confidently ask a clinical question, analyze
        the AI tools that exist, and approach several types of biomedical
        datasets using various ML techniques.

      <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        It is time for medical schools to consider including content focused on
        ML and its applications as part of their curriculum. Medical students,
        residents, and fellows should have knowledge of ML and data science
        during their training period. This will only become a reality when
        medical schools begin to create curricular time for ML with an
        acknowledgment of the changes to come in healthcare, and there is no
        better time to do it than now.
